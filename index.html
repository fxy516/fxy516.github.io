            Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.<br>
        Ever since 1971, Queen gained huge success worldwide, with a total release of 15 studio albums and other live albums. 
        On 23rd November 1991, Freddie Mercury announced to the world that he had AIDS and the next day he died peacefully at his home, surrounded by family and friends. He remains the most high profile loss from the disease in the entertainment world and the news shocked fans throughout the world. <br>
        In 2004, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Walk of Fame, and in the UK were voted by the public into the first UK Music Hall of Fame.<br>
        Since 2012, Queen have enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with US singer/songwriter Adam Lambert and have toured extensively across North and South America, Europe, the UK, Asia and Australia and New Zealand.<br>
